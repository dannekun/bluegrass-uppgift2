Exercise instructions
1) Look at the overview picture
2) Exercise is to be solved with Java. Any IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ). 
   Any java classes, frameworks, any StackOverflow solutions could be used. 
   Be prepared to motivate your choices.
3) If you think some info are missing, make and document assumptions.
4) Start to connect to SMHI APIs. More info here:

   https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/metobs/codeexamples.html#java_json
   https://opendata-download-metobs.smhi.se/api/version/1.0/parameter/1/station/159880.json
   https://opendata-download-metobs.smhi.se/api/version/1.0/parameter/1/station/159880/period/latest-hour.json
   https://opendata-download-metobs.smhi.se/api/version/1.0/parameter/1/station/159880/period/latest-hour/data.json
   Note: You need to call last API three times to get data for all three parameters (1,3,4)
5) Call the APIs with a frequency that should be set in a configuration file to be read when you start your app/program
6) Call the APIs with a specific weather station configured in the same file as above   
7) Call the APIs with a period=latest-hour. Ignore that you could call with other period vaules.
8) Note: date field in json is seconds since 1:th of January 1970. https://www.epochconverter.com/
9) Merge the three responses from the API calls to one XML. See XML schema and XML sample.
10) Transform XML to a flat file and copy to a configurable directory
11) Save XML data to a simple SQL table in a DB of your choice with at least the following row info:
	station_id, timestamp, temp, direction, speed.
12) It is not important to have a flashy user interface.
13) It is important to:
	- Motivate your choices
	- Write structured code
	- Write well documented code
	- If you copy-paste code, make sure that you understand the code you copy.
14) When you are done, send the solution to us and we will review it on our own first.
15) As a second step you will present and explain (in detail) your solution to us.
16) As a last step you will demo your solution to us but 15) is of more importance
